limesctl is the CLI client for [Limes][limes].

## Installation

You can download the latest pre-compiled binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/sapcc/limesctl/releases/latest).

Alternatively, you can also build from source:

The only required build dependency is [Go](https://golang.org/). 

```
$ go get github.com/sapcc/limesctl
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sapcc/limesctl
$ make install
```

this will put the binary in `/usr/bin/limesctl` or `/usr/local/bin/limesctl` for macOS.


## Usage

To get an overview of all the operations that are available:

```
$ limesctl help
```

limesctl requires a valid Keystone Token for all its operation. Your mileage may vary depending on your authorization scope.

### Shell autocompletion

limesctl includes autocompletion support, which can save some amount of typing.

The completion script itself is generated by limesctl, so you just need to invoke it from your shell profile.


You can run the following statements to get autocompletion for the current shell session or you can add them to your shell's configuration file to get autocompletion for all future sessions.

Bash:

```
$ eval "$(limesctl --completion-script-bash)"
```

Zsh:

```
$ eval "$(limesctl --completion-script-zsh)"
```
